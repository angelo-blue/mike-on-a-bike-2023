    <h2 id="stage1">Hot day from Heilbronn</h2>

    <p>I caught the train, with bike, to Heilbronn and stayed at the YHA. The building (not my room sadly) overlooks the Neckar river – a nice coincidence as this will be a bike ride along rivers.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="assets/stage1/heilbronn-neckar.jpeg">
        <figcaption>Neckar river, Heilbronn</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Being jet lagged it was no problem to start early – I was packed and ready by 5.30 am. The paid-for breakfast at 7 was the only thing holding me back.</p>

    <p>On my way (not even) and a big problem- the plug connecting the phone to the ebike didn’t fit! I was relying on my phone for navigation, and it wouldn’t get through a day without battery assistance. Luckily I had my pocket knife and some trimming of the plastic did the trick.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="assets/stage1/plastic-trimming.jpeg">
    </figure>

    <p>It turned out to be a perfect start to a trip. Problem arisen, problem resolved. Feeling confident, I started biking out of Heilbronn.</p>

    <img src="assets/stage1/bikepath.jpeg">

    <p>First stop at 9.15. You see these a lot in Germany – a bench and a cross, under a tree (usually seems to be a chestnut tree).</p>

    <img src="assets/stage1/bench.jpeg">

    <p>I carried on biking. I had left the easy paths along Neckar river now, and gone up and over a hill. Temperature was hitting 30 degrees. I gave in and turned the ebike assistance on.
    </p>

    <p>Just short of Jagsthausen I came to a information sign about the Roman Limes.
    </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="assets/stage1/limes.jpeg">
        <figcaption>Site of Roman frontier</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The Roman Limes was the Roman frontier in Germany. The Romans didn’t stop at the Rhine – this is about 100 km inland from the Rhine. The frontier – watchtowers and forts – ran right through this spot around 100-200 A.D. Romans to the west, German tribes to the east.
    </p>

    <p>Now I was biking along the Jagst river. Lots of agriculture, ploughed fields, sunflowers, apple trees.
    </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="assets/stage1/swans.jpeg">
        <figcaption>Swans on Jagst</figcaption>

    <p>It was a hot hot afternoon. Any resting spot in the shade was an excuse for a rest.
    </p>

    <figure>

        <figcaption>Even the air in the shade is hot</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>One final watershed to cross – I left the Jagst, up and over the hill, and down toward Bad Mergentheim.
    </p>

    <h2 id="stage2">Up the Tauber</h2>

    <p>I slept right through until 4.30 am, which is pretty good for the second night of jet lag. Flicked through the German TV channels after that. Nothing of interest there, just like at home. So I just lay in bed and appreciated the hotel room decor.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="assets/stage2/hotel-room.jpeg">
    </figure>

    <p>Biked out of Bad Mergentheim about 8.30, along the Tauber river, which I followed the whole day. I left the town pretty quickly, then some semi-rural lifestyle area – lots of horses.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="assets/stage2/markelsheim.jpeg">
        <figcaption>Lord of the rings-style statues</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Stopped for morning tea at Weikersheim. When I stop I often google the town to find out some history – most of these smaller towns were first recorded around 1100-1200… longer ago than people have lived in New Zealand.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="assets/stage2/weikersheim.jpeg">

        <img src="assets/stage2/weikersheim-tower.jpeg">
        <figcaption>Lots of these towers-with-tunnels in this area</figcaption>
    </figure>

        <p>Biked on and through some smaller agricultural towns. It was often pretty smelly – silage and animals, and hot days with no wind to freshen the air.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="assets/stage2/pigs.jpeg">
        <figcaption>Happy pigs</figcaption>
    </figure>

        <p>Again, lots of apple trees on the side of the path. It’s great help for a biker or walker on a hot day. We should plant apple trees on the side of the tracks in New Zealand… perhaps one of the politicians could adopt this policy for the election. Would get my vote.</p>

        <p>Near Creglingen I took a short detour to see a famous wood carving from the early 1500s. It’s 10 meters tall and very intricate. Even the small figures look good close up.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage2/marienalter.jpeg" >
            <figcaption>Marienalter by Tilman Riemenschneider</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Not tempted by the thimble museum across the road, I carried on biking in the heat.</p>

        <p>About 2pm I rounded a corner and saw my destination up on the hill – Rothenburg.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage2/rothenburg-on-hill.jpeg">
        </figure>

        <p>Biked up over the cobblestones and through the gate in the wall to find my accommodation. Lots of tourists when I arrived, but it seemed to empty out later on – perhaps the tour buses had left.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage2/rothenburg1.jpeg">
        </figure>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage2/rothenburg3.jpeg">
        </figure>

        <p>Rothenburg is a walled town famous for it’s medieval architecture. It’s surprisingly big. It took me about an hour to walk around the town on the wall tops.</p>

    <p>September 10, 2023. 56 km.</p>
    <img src="assets/stage2/route.jpeg">

        <hr/>

        <h2 id="stage3">Early start to Erlangen</h3>

          <p>Got up before dawn to finish the wall walk – you can walk right around Rothenburg on top of the walls. Most of it is covered with a low ceiling which meant I had to hunch over while walking. I tried not to stare too much at the houses, as it’s not a museum – people are living there just getting up and going about their day.</p>

          <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage3/rothenburg-walls.jpeg" >
        </figure>

        <p>Breakfast at the YHA, then back on the bike. I left the old town and saw some of the “new” Rothenburg – just a normal looking town with houses, industrial areas and petrol stations. But it only took ten minutes and I was in the countryside.</p>

        <p>Up a big hill and through a small town. Today I’m not on an established cycle path, I just let the app find the best cycling route between Rothenburg and Erlangen. It’s already apparent that it’s going to be a mishmash of rural roads, small towns and cycle paths.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage3/forest.jpeg" >
        </figure>

        <p>Stopped at the top of a small incline. There’s a small collection of signs there. Not unusual as there are little signs everywhere on these trails and small roads. But this is interesting.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage3/wasserscheidweg.jpeg">
        </figure>

        <p>I’m on the European Wasserscheidweg. This is the watershed between the Rhine and the Danube. It’s not a dramatic ridge or anything momentous – more like rolling hills that just rolled a little higher. But it’s nice to think I’m now in Danube country, as I’ll be biking down that river in a few days.</p>

        <p>Continued biking up some rural roads. Very very quiet. Monday morning.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage3/haybales.jpeg">
            <figcaption>Germany may have good cars but the hay bale stacking is low quality</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Stopped for lunch at a town Neuhof an der Zenn. Hot day again, the bench under the tree in the town square looking good.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage3/neuhof.jpeg" >
        </figure>

        <p>Bought a cold drink at a very small shop from a woman with a strong Franconian accent (zwoh instead of zwei). Just when you’re starting to get confidence with the language, you hit something like this which throws things into disarray…</p>

        <p>I crossed into a flatter, more populated area. Lots of vegetable farming – pumpkins, zucchini, lettuce. Some of the way on the side of a busy road. Time to get to the end.</p>

        <figure>

        <h2 id="stage4">Down the Danube from Passau</h3>

        <p>We drove in the van, four of us, down to Passau to begin the bike trip down the Danube. One van, three bikes – an e-bike, a non-e-bike, and a recliner bike.</p>
        <p>The first bridge was closed for repairs – never mind, there’s a ferry a little further. We boarded the ferry, and what do you know it sells little bottles of schnapps for a couple of euro’s. A nice way to start a bike tour. About half a kilometre down and we are fortified with Schnapps.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage4/ferry.jpeg" >
            <figcaption>About to pay the ferryman</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Off the ferry and on our way. Beside the Danube. It’s perfect weather – cloudy, low twenties. The valley closes in and it’s forested, the hills a little rocky.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage4/danube-valley.jpeg" >
        </figure>
        <p>The Danube makes a kind of S-bend here and we need to cross to the other side to meet the van at the campsite. There’s another ferry here.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage4/ferry-gong.jpeg" >
            <figcaption>Bang a Gong</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The ferry is unattended – but there’s a hammer and a gong, and a house about 70 m away. I hit the gong and about 5 minutes later a ferry-lady appears and we are on our way with more schnapps.</p>
        <p>Campsite today is at Inzell and it’s a beautiful spot.</p>

        <h2 id="stage5">Down the Danube some more</h3>

        <p>Getting ready to go, along with a handful of other bikers at the same campground. Not many – September is off-peak season. One guy I talk to has biked from France and is finishing in Budapest, that’s 50 days down and 9 to go.</p>
        <p>Anyway, my turn on the recliner this morning.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage5/recliner.jpg" >

            <figcaption>Waiting</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Mid-morning the clouds clear and it gets hot. 29 degrees. But it’s flat and easy, mostly on a dedicated cycleway. We’re following a well established route – the Danube cycleway. And we are biking the most popular section, the Austrian section.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage5/danube-route.jpeg" >
            <figcaption>The plan</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>One big city (Linz) and some smaller towns today. We stop at Wilhering for a coffee. Nice town square which we have almost to ourselves, and a very ornate church. This is a town of only about 6000 people. But when you’ve had eight hundred years worth of taxing the peasants then I suppose you can create some lasting effect…</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Another ferry crossing after Wilhering. This one is a water powered ferry – just a cable and a rudder and the current pushes the boat across the river.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage5/wilhering-ferry.jpeg" >
        </figure>
        <p>Long day today – arrived at the campsite (AuSee), covered in sweat and sunscreen, as dusk was falling.</p>

        <p>September 15, 2023. 74 km.</p>
        <img src="assets/stage5/route-day1.jpeg">
        <hr/>

        <h3>The next day</h3>
        <p>First stop is Mauthausen – just off the river and up a hill.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage5/mauthausen.jpeg" >
            <figcaption> Mauthausen</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>That’s no castle, it is a former concentration camp. Now it’s a tourist site (although they prefer the term memorial of course) full of people looking around, including a lot of school groups.</p>
        <p>The prisoners had to carry large stone blocks from the quarry, up the steps. Then repeat. In winter, in summer.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage5/mauthausen-steps.jpeg" >
            <figcaption>Steep steps</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If you didn’t know the history of those steps, that would be a nice scenic outlook.</p>
        <p>On the bikes again. Another 29 degree day.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage5/on-the-road-again.jpeg" >
        </figure>
        <p>Most of the afternoon is beside the Danube in flat country.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage5/stop-by-river.jpeg" >
        </figure>
        <p>Biking downstream beside a river is pleasant and easy. The same path without a river wouldn’t be nearly as good. We keep pedalling along. There’s an occasional cruise ship powering past, or another cyclist, but mostly just us and the slowly drifting water.</p>
        <p>The afternoon passes and the valley closes in once again. We arrive in Grein where we will camp tonight. I’ve done 30 km on the recliner today and am pretty sore.</p>

        <h2 id="stage6">To Krems</h3>

        <h3>Signs</h3>
        <p>There’s some unusual signage here in Austria…</p>
        <p>Anyway, my turn on the recliner this morning.</p>

        <h3>Grein to Marbach</h3>
        <p>A bit of a change this morning with a little hike up <i>Stillensteinklamm</i>, a 5km loop going up a steep stony gorge.</p>
        <p>But then back to the business of biking to Vienna. Caught the ferry from Grein across the river and set off. Nice morning, already quite hot. And the Danube is finally looking blue!</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/stage6/ybbs.jpeg" >
            <figcaption>Blue Danube at Ybbs</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We stop at Ybbs for a break, under some shady trees. Now it’s starting to be a bit more populated, a few more castles on the hills. We are getting closer to Vienna.</p>
        <p>A headwind gets pretty strong. <i>Gegendwind</i> in German – “against wind”. There’s nothing to be done except push through.</p>
        <p>There’s a kayaker going down river that we are keeping pace with. Where did they start? Where are they going to? Who knows. There’s a few hydro dams they have to negotiate – must be a bit tricky with a kayak.</p>
        <p>We catch another ferry to cross over to Marbach where we camp for the night.</p>

        <p>I get up early and go got a walk along Marbach. Nice town – but with it’s best days behind it, if I had to guess. We’re not too far from Vienna now. In earlier days it may have been a useful river stop. Now with a car or fast boat, perhaps not so much.</p>
        <p>Still, the campground is full. Lots of retirees in their campervans enjoying the post-school-holiday season.</p>
        <p>There’s a vending machine here and I use some spare change to get an Almdudler for breakfast. It’s like the Austrian version of L&P.</p>

        <p>Today our first stop is at Melk where there is a famous abbey up by on a hill. It’s managed to survive for over nine hundred years (not that building in the photo – that’s only 300 years old).</p>

        <p>We go up and look around. It’s big and spectacular. It’s also a busy spot, Melk abbey, and I hear quite a few American accents. Must be a stop for the cruise boats.</p>
        <p>Sit down for an expensive coffee (Melk where they milk the tourists). On we go.</p>

        <p>There’s a few road works and detours to negotiate today. The traffic, when we’re on a road, is normally pretty considerate of bikers. Just as well – as I’m on the recliner on the road sections today.</p>
        <p>Finish today in Krems. Two more days to Vienna.</p>

        <h2 id="stage7">Krems to Vienna</h3>

        <p>Found a nice Bakery this morning and got some apple strudels for breakfast. They don’t seem to be rolled up the way I thought they were meant to be – more like a big pastry pocket full of spiced apple. No matter, tasty and filling.</p>
        <p>Back over the bridge and on our way. There’s no cycle lane on the bridge – you just ride along and the cars wait behind you. Once again, blue sky and hot day. There’s some kind of a reserve wilderness area here.</p>

        <p>At midday we reach the Zwentendorf nuclear station, a monument to bad planning, selfish activists, or people power, take your pick.</p>

        <p>It was built in the mid 1970s. There was of course some opposition. The opponents managed to get a referendum organised, which the noes won with just 50.4%. So it was built (which cost billions of dollars) but never switched on. The poor old Austrian taxpayers.</p>
        <p>I wonder what the referendum result would be now?</p>
        <p>On we go. Through a farming area. Someone’s kindly provided some drinking water.</p>

        <p>Campsite tonight is at Tulln. We go for a swim at a lake just next to the camp site.</p>

        <h3>The next day</h3>
        <p>Tonight we take Vienna. But first there’s a bit more biking.</p>

        <p>Another warm day but at least it’s cloudy, so don’t need to smear on the sunscreen quite so thickly.</p>
        <p>Stop in Heiligenstadt to visit the Beethoven house – he lived in this house for a while, now it’s a museum. This place used to be a village where successful Viennese could get away from the city life – but now it’s part of the city anyway.</p>

        <p>This is where the culture begins.</p>
        <p>It’s only less than an hour now to the centre of Vienna, to climb up St Stephens cathedral. Thats the end of the road for us.</p>
        <p>September 20, 2023. 45 km.</p>

        <h3>Vienna</h3>
        <p>Vienna is huge. And super-busy in the centre. Biking around at night is a blast – avoiding pedestrians, cars, bikes, and trams… no helmet, and warm enough to be in a tshirt.</p>
